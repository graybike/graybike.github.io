    <p>Gray Bike is a small software consultancy in San Francisco. We work with designers &amp; developers to build digital products for small businesses, non-profits, and startups. We believe communication and collaboration are paramount to the success of any project we work on. That's why we'll work hard to understand your needs, and make sure we're in constant communication with you as we move from concept to launch. We work best with clients that value these same principles, and trust us to provide valuable critique throughout the process.</p>
    
    <p>All of our projects are led by our Founder &amp; Principal, Pavan Trikutam, and we hire additional talent as needed on a per-project basis. We're small and nimble, and intend to stay that way. If you're looking for a large agency with an army of employees, we're probably not the best fit. However, if you have a project that would work with a small, responsive team that can accomplish big things, we can help.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

    <blockquote>Pavan is excellent at analyzing websites. He helped us in simplifying our homepage design and focusing on the primary value we provide our users. Going through discovery with Pavan helped us identify the various choices we have and consciously pick the ones we felt we were best suited to execute. I would happily recommend Pavan to anyone that needs guidance in improving the design or conversion rates of their websites.<cite>Pradeep Chauhan, CEO of OnContracting.com</cite></blockquote>
    <blockquote>Pavan took our web site and rebuilt it with our new products and markets, made it very clean and usable and did so quickly, efficiently and in a manner that will allow us to grow for some time.  The overall work was of a first class quality and I recommend Pavan without reservation and with the highest of accolades. And he is a great guy! <cite>Brian Bogosian, CEO of SALT Technology</cite></blockquote>
    <blockquote>Pavan is a very talented engineer. We have worked with Pavan since he was at Moovweb and exclusively use his services for iOS/Android app changes. He is very hands on, easy going and a great fit for our demanding culture. Pavan sticks to his timelines and price quotes.<cite>Kapil Bansal, Director, Mobile at 1800flowers.com</cite></blockquote>
