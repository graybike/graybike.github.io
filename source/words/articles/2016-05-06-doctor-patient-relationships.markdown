I recently read a book by Atul Gawande called _[Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End]_. It's an intense, beautiful, book that explores the complexities of how medicine is used to treat us when we're near the end of our lives. The book is full of amazing, compassionate stories and ideas. I can't recommend it enough.

I was thinking about one of the passages in the book:

> During medical school, my fellow classmates and I were assigned to read a short paper ... on the different kinds of relationships that we, as budding new clinicians, might have with our patients. The oldest, most traditional kind is a paternalistic relationship—we are medical authorities aiming to ensure that patients receive what we believe best for them. We have the knowledge and experience. We make the critical choices. If there were a red pill and a blue pill, we would tell you, “Take the red pill. It will be good for you.” We might tell you about the blue pill; but then again, we might not. We tell you only what we believe you need to know. It is the priestly, doctor-knows-best model, and although often denounced it remains a common mode, especially with vulnerable patients—the frail, the poor, the elderly, and anyone else who tends to do what they’re told.
>
> The second type of relationship the authors termed “informative.” It’s the opposite of the paternalistic relationship. We tell you the facts and figures. The rest is up to you. “Here’s what the red pill does, and here’s what the blue pill does,” we would say. “Which one do you want?” It’s a retail relationship. The doctor is the technical expert. The patient is the consumer. The job of doctors is to supply up-to-date knowledge and skills. The job of patients is to supply the decisions. This is the increasingly common way for doctors to be, and it tends to drive us to become ever more specialized. We know less and less about our patients but more and more about our science. Overall, this kind of relationship can work beautifully, especially when the choices are clear, the trade-offs are straightforward, and people have clear preferences. You get only the tests, the pills, the operations, the risks that you want and accept. You have complete autonomy.

Gawande goes a little further to explain:

> In truth, neither type is quite what people desire. We want information and control, but we also want guidance. The [authors] described a third type of doctor-patient relationship, which they called “interpretive.” Here the doctor’s role is to help patients determine what they want. Interpretive doctors ask, “What is most important to you? What are your worries?” Then, when they know your answers, they tell you about the red pill and the blue pill and which one would most help you achieve your priorities.

Let me preface what I'm about to say with this: By NO means do I consider what we do here at Gray Bike as meaningful, as complex, or as critical as practicing medicine. Especially for those with terminal illnesses or those who are dying.

That being said, I definitely think there are parallels between the relationship a doctor has with their patient and a consultant has with their client. We are both experts providing a service to people. Our clients (or patients) probably don't understand what we do as well, and for good reason. We've spent years honing our expertise. And there are a lot of service providers that fall into the "paternalistic" camp as well as the "retail" camp. In both cases, I don't think it's good. I aim to be the third type of service provider that Gawande speaks about.

Even when I'm the client, I look for people who are interested in the third type of relationships. Building technology requires collaboration. I'm giving you something pre-built -- we're building something together. I want to learn about your business and understand your goals first. We should weigh the options together, understand the technical tradeoffs, and make the decision as a team. Ultimately, the service I want to provide is a partnership. If we're working together, we're both invested in making the project a success. This requires communication and collaboration.


I think for developers and designers, there's another type of relationship: the client will provide a set of instructions, and we follow it blindly. “Make the button bigger.” OK, it's bigger now. “Add a sharing button.” Ok, there's a sharing button now. “Ensure the website pops up a form to collect email on every page load.” Yes ma'am.

You get the idea.



That's the type of consulting I'd like to aim to be.
