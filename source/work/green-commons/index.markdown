## The Project

[Green Commons] is a knowledge-sharing, learning platform for environmental research and action. It provides a place for people working on environmental issues to find and share resources, information, and ideas; to build networks; and to work collaboratively . We aim to provide users the information and tools that will help them create amore sustainable world.


## The Challenge

Island Press, along with [David Weinberger](http://weinberger.org/), approached Gray Bike in 2016 to embark on an ambitious project. They wanted to build a knowledge-sharing and learning platform geared towards people working on environmental issues. When they approached us, it was just an idea with perhaps a few documents outlining features. Over the course of the next 12 months, we worked closely with the Island Press team to go from idea to design to execution. Oh, and did we mention [it's open source]?

Green Commons is an ongoing project, and weâ€™ll continue to be their primary technical partner as the project grows, evolves, and scales.

### User Research & Discovery

Though Island Press came prepared with a series of features and product ideas for the platform, our first step was to do extensive user reasearch. We interviewed journalists, scientists, policymakers, activists, and professors. Taking meticulous notes throughout the process, we were able to discern a number of shortcomings that people had with their existing

### Design

From a series of documents outlining features, Gray Bike worked with the Island Press team to distill these down into a set of wireframes.
