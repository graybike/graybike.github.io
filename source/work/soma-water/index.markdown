[Soma Water] makes beautiful, sustainable water filters. They’re on a mission to improve life for everyone who drinks water: every water filter sold helps benefit organizations like charity: water who are working to solve the global water crisis. They’re an awesome, design-focused company that has been growing like crazy.


Gray Bike is proud  to say we’ve been Soma’s technical partner (think outsourced CTO) for almost two years now. **We’ve provided engineering services that have helped grow their subscriber count over 300%** over the course of our partnership. We provide a small team of engineers, working remotely, to manage their entire engineering infrastructure. 

### Redesigning the new website
In early 2015, Soma wanted to rebuild their website to coincide with the launch of their new product, the [Soma Pitcher]. Their current site at the time didn’t support handling multiple products, provided for a inflexible checkout experience, and was in need of a general facelift. And it needed to work great on mobile and tablet devices, as well.

Before starting, Gray Bike helped Soma evaluate all e-commerce options out there. We wanted to make sure we used the right tool for the job. After lots of research and analysis, we realized that building our own solution was the way to go -- it was the only way to have the full control & flexibility in the user experience that Soma wanted to deliver.

We worked closely with their creative director and front end developer to implement a lightweight, beautiful, new front end on Soma’s site. We updated their back end to support multiple products, as well as refactoring the existing code to support an entirely new checkout flow. Soma’s customers now have a much more streamlined experience when browsing and purchasing products on the Soma website.  This was a huge win for Soma: we were able to **increase sales by 40%** in the first 3 months after launch.

Major thanks to [Liang Shi], former Creative Director of Soma and [Patrick Johnson], our front-end guru extraordinaire.

He was able to put a new face on our website and vastly improve the capabilities of our platform -- leading to many more sales and happier customers! He has a great ability to take our business problems and solve them with his engineering expertise. We look forward to continuing to work with him!”

### Moving to a new admin system
When Soma’s website was originally built, their customer experience team was small and used a custom-built, out of date admin system to manage support tasks. As time went on, they began to outgrow the system and needed something more robust and stable.

We’ve spent lots of time with their customer success team to understand how they work, where their pain points are, and where we could improve the system. We implemented a much more stable and well supported open source system, and spent the necessary time customizing a much more powerful, well supported open source admin system. With the newer, more stable system, the customer experience team is able to get things done quicker and scale with confidence.

Every week, we work closely with their whole team, maintaining and improving their e-commerce website and infrastructure. We advise them on strategy, growth, and all things technical, acting as their CTO-for-hire throughout our relationship. Soma Water has done amazing things to give back to the community. We’re proud to call them our partner, and look forward to helping them with their mission well into the future.
