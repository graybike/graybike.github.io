## Copy from old about section

Gray Bike is a small software consultancy in San Francisco. We work with designers & developers to build digital products for small businesses, non-profits, and startups. We believe communication and collaboration are paramount to the success of any project we work on. That's why we'll work hard to understand your needs, and make sure we're in constant communication with you as we move from concept to launch. We work best with clients that value these same principles, and trust us to provide valuable critique throughout the process.

All of our projects are led by our Founder & Principal, Pavan Trikutam, and we hire additional talent as needed on a per-project basis. We're small and nimble, and intend to stay that way. If you're looking for a large agency with an army of employees, we're probably not the best fit. However, if you have a project that would work with a small, responsive team that can accomplish big things, we can help.</p>
