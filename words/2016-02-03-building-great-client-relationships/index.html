          Some musings on what it takes to make clients happy and build lasting relationships.
        </h2>
        <p class='date'>
          Feb  3, 2016
        </p>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve been a software consultant for 6 years now. I&rsquo;ve worked with all sorts of clients: small businesses, non profits, individuals, and even large enterprise organizations. Admittedly, this is just a drop in the bucket over the span of an entire career, but during this time I&rsquo;ve learned a ton.</p>
        
        <p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about about what it takes to have happy clients. I have great relationships with my clients because of three things: communication, responsiveness, and honesty. I know, it sounds super cheesy, I know. But these to me have been more important than the work itself.</p>
        
        <p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the actual work you do is very important. <em>Do the best damn job you can.</em> Seriously. However, giving yourself the space to do a good job is accomplished by being honest about what it&rsquo;s going to take. It&rsquo;s about communicating issues properly so you and your client can find solutions together.</p>
        
        <h3>Communication</h3>
        
        <p>As an expert in your field, it&rsquo;s up to you to translate technical/advanced concepts into terms that non-technical folks can understand. They&rsquo;re hiring you not only to do the job, but to communicate clearly what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
        
        <p>Communication is about guidance. Give your clients enough information to make decisions on their own. Don&rsquo;t just tell them why doing something is bad, help them understand <em>why</em>. I can&rsquo;t stand when developers say &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do it because it&rsquo;s the wrong way.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s obvious to you may not be obvious to the client. Take the time to talk about tradeoffs, costs, and timelines so clients can decide what&rsquo;s best for their business.</p>
        
        <p>Similarly, if they&rsquo;re requesting something to be built or designed &ndash; dig deeper. Find out what the core problem is, and see if you can work together to find a better way to solve it.</p>
        
        <p>Doing this is hard. It takes practice. But it&rsquo;s well worth it. When you&rsquo;re able to effectively translate your knowledge about a problem or project, you&rsquo;re bringing the client into the process and helping them make an informed decision.</p>
        
        <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
        
        <p>This one is so damn easy. I don&rsquo;t understand why people aren&rsquo;t better at this. So much of the fear of hiring a developer or a freelancer is that they&rsquo;ll go silent when there are questions that need to be answered.</p>
        
        <p>It makes sense. People want to know you&rsquo;re available, that you&rsquo;re not going to just disappear with all their money. They&rsquo;re putting a lot of trust into you by agreeing to work with you. If you get an email, slack message, text, call, whatever &ndash; just respond. That&rsquo;s it. If you don&rsquo;t know the answer, say &ldquo;Let me check it out and get back to you.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>That&rsquo;s so much better than silence. When you&rsquo;re absoutely silent, you build resentment. By the end of the project, there is a much lower chance the client will be happy and want to work with you again.</p>
        
        <h3>Honesty</h3>
        
        <p>Being straight up with your clients (and prospective clients) is the best way to build trust. It lets them know you&rsquo;re not just going to agree to anything they request, and that you really have their best interests at heart.</p>
        
        <p>Sometimes when someone comes to me with an idea, I point them to a solution that doesn&rsquo;t involve me at all. Things like showing them how to create an awesome onboarding process using <a href="http://www.typeform.com/">Typeform</a>, or telling them that <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> can be a beautiful solution for what they&rsquo;re looking for. Or that <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> can be set up by someone with no coding experience at all. All of these tools have a ton of themes and add-ons that require no additional coding to manage. Often, the right answer is &ldquo;You probably shouldn&rsquo;t pay me a bunch of money to build something that you could get online for cheap, if not free.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>Other times, people will come to me with extremely unrealistic expectations. They might want to build a massive application within a month. Well, the reality of it is that while we could get <em>something</em> out in a month, it won&rsquo;t be good. And they&rsquo;ll definitely end up paying for it down the line.</p>
        
        <p>In both of these cases, I&rsquo;d rather turn down the project or send back a realistic estimate, even if it&rsquo;s not exactly what the client originally wanted.</p>
        
        <p><hr></p>
        
        <p>Most of this stuff is pretty common sense. Building a good relationship is easy. Be a good communicator, be responsive and be honest. Over time, you&rsquo;ll build up trust. If your clients trust you, they&rsquo;ll be more open to your input on projects. They&rsquo;ll be more open to referring work to you. They&rsquo;ll do everything they can to help you be successful, since you&rsquo;ve already done the same for them.</p>
        
        <p>As an expert, our skills are temporary. Half of our knowledge becomes obselete every few years. However, as a consultant, as a collaborator &ndash; the necessary skills don&rsquo;t change. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s really important to constantly practice them and get it right.</p>
