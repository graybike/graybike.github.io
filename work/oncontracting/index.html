    <h3 class="section-header">OVERVIEW</h3>
    <p>OnContracting is a community where contract job seekers can research companies, find jobs, and connect with recruiters. It provides information to the jobseeker to empower them to make the right decision when considering what company to work for and what staffing agencies to work with. OnContracting approached me to help them analyze & improve the UX for their site.</p>

    <h5 class="section-subheader">WHAT I DID</h5>
    <p>I helped OnContracting better understand their target audience, their business goals & strategy, and the best way to attract new customers. We walked through a few UX exercises, user research, and other forms of analysis to better understand how to improve the user experience & user engagement on the site. This culminated in a redesign of the landing page, though more changes are likely to be implemented in the future.</p>

      <p>This is the redesigned landing page. The old page was cluttered, confusing, and had a lot going on. The new page we designed was simpler, with a clear call to action and description of the company & its value proposition.</p>
