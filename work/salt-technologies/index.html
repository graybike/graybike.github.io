    <h3 class="section-header">OVERVIEW</h3>
    <p>SALT Technologies is a financial payments startup based in San Francisco. They provide payment processing (among other financial services) for developers and merchants of any size -- small to enterprise. They approached me to help them rebuild their website with a new look & feel, and content strategy. Their old website's content was disorganized, confusing, and chaotic-- I helped them unify it and improve their messaging to be much more effective.</p>

    <h5 class="section-subheader">WHAT I DID</h5>
    <p>I provided all the services, from content strategy, to ux design, to development. I did a full content audit of all the information they had on their old site, provided a new content strategy for their new site, and design & implemented their new site. I built their website on the Wordpress platform and customized the theme heavily to match their needs. Of course, the design was created to be responsive to have their site look good on any screen size.</p>

    <p>Here's the new website I designed. The messaging & content are clear and direct, and there's a clear call to action for new users.</p>

    <h4 class="section-header">OLD HOMEPAGE</h4>
    <p>For reference, here are the pages from the old website. There's no clear organization of content, walls of text, and no calls to action.</p>
