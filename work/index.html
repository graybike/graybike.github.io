            I led the engineering efforts for a massive redesign for Soma's e-commerce website. Working closely with design and marketing,
            <span class='emphasize'>we were able to increase sales by 40%</span>
            in the first 3 months after launch. I worked closely with

            at Soma and
            <a href='http://pbj.me/' target='_blank'>Patrick Johnson</a>
            to bring this project to life.

            Cell Signal Technology wanted to build a visualization that provided information on their product catalog, as well as inform the viewer about protein pathways available in the cell. They hired Captains of Industry, who brought me on to build the data viz. I worked closely with design througout and built the entire visualization.

            <p>We came to Pavan with an complex, abstract problem: we needed a team member to help us develop an interactive data visualization to represent complex biology concepts while highlighting our client's product offering. Pavan's versatile knowledge surrounding data visualization was invaluable in creating a scientifically accurate visualization that was easy to understand and looked great. The visualization gave excellent exposure to our client's product line. Pavan is a great engineer, thinker, and communicator -- we'd hire him again in a heartbeat!</p>

            Hummings is a mobile-first personal finance companion app. They came to me with early stage wireframes, and I guided them through UX revisions and product development. Once designs were finalized, I put together a small engineering team to build out the entire app.

            <p>We started working with Pavan at Gray Bike for our MVP app (www.hellohummings.com) at the wireframe stage. Pavan quickly grasped the vision of our product and provided a great deal of insights to shape our UX, product architecture, and the engineering milestones. He also came up with really smart solutions to leverage existing tools & frameworks to optimize the custom coding work.</p>
            <p>Throughout the project, Pavan was professional, prompt, reliable, and communicated very well. He is very methodical, tested rigorously, and was very smart about figuring out the bugs. He also worked hard to make sure the project delivered on time - we were actually a week early. This was the most enjoyable and "glitch-free" software development experience I've had to-date.</p>
            <p>Our ultimate product was clean, beautiful, and stable. Pavan was more than an engineer. He was an integral part of our product team. We really enjoyed working with him and would happily recommend him to anyone looking for a technical partner for their next project.</p>
